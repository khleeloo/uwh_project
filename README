Deep Learning Methods:

GAN Model

- Utilize out of the shelf pix2pix model. Treating the image enhancement problem as a style transfer. Training dataset in form of aligned input and ground truth data. 


Diffusion Model

- Utilize the out of the shelf Palette model for the translation. We modifed the gray-to-color generation setting of the original Palette to adapt to our task.
